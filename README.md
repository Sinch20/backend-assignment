### True Value Access - Backend Assignment
Create REST APIs using Python (Flask, Django, any other web framework of your choice) for managing the userâ€™s data.
The rest framework used is Django and the database selected for managing the user data is SQLite. 
The user data has been taken from the sample data already given. It is assumed as employee (user) data. 
The API has the following functionalities:

#### 1. List users 
This functionality lists all the users in the database (There are 500 users in the given sample data). The endpoint for this is taken as - '/api/users GET'

#### 2. Search for a user by name 
Search functionality has been implemented which checks for the first_name and last_name and renders the user whose name matches.
Example Response: for searching a particular name (first name or last name). Here we are searching for Josephine
```js
   [

    "previous": null,
